## Getting Started

To use the Funny Calculator:

1. Clone this repository or download the project files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. Start calculating and enjoy the funny messages for easy calculations!

## File Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the calculator.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the calculator.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the logic for calculations, keypress events, and funny messages.

## How It Works

The calculator supports the following features:
1. **Arithmetic Operations**: You can perform basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator also supports modulus (`%`).
2. **Funny Responses**: For calculations that are too simple (like single-digit additions or multiplication), the calculator will respond with one of several pre-defined funny messages.
3. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: You can type numbers and operators directly from your keyboard, and hit "Enter" to calculate or "Backspace" to delete the last character.
4. **Clear**: Press "AC" to reset the calculator.

## Example Calculations

- **Simple Calculation**: `2 + 2`
    - Result: Funny message: "Did you really need a calculator for this? ðŸ˜†"
- **Complex Calculation**: `2.05 + 3.07`
    - Result: Shows the result `5.12` without any funny message.
- **Invalid Input**: If the input is invalid, the calculator will display: "Invalid input!"

## Customization

You can customize the funny messages or the calculator's appearance by modifying the `script.js` or `style.css` files. Add new messages or change the button layout as needed!
